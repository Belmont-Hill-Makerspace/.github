<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

> Quick-start guide for robotics development: essential tools, resources, and onboarding instructions for new and returning team members.

### Installation

The development of these project requires the use of some key tools that help reduce the pain points of robotics. Ensure you have the following:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/): a version control system for tracking code changes and team collaboration
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/): interact with Team 35075 remote code repositories
- [C++ Compiler](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html): a toolchain for compiling and running C++ programs, typically pre-installed on most systems
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): integrated development environment (IDE)
- [VEX Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VEXRobotics.vexcode): an extension for managing and developing VEX robotics projects efficiently
- [PROS Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sigbots.pros): extension for Visual Studio Code to streamline VEX using the PROS framework

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

> Step-by-step guide to update code, prepare the robot, and deploy logic for seamless operation.


1. Code update: pull any potential changes from the repository to your local machine.
2. Robot setup: check and fill air canisters, ensure battery is charged, and power on the robot.
3. Controller connect: link controller to VEX Robot Brain with and ensure the controller is on.
4. Logic upload: push updated code to VEX brain using a Micro-USB port at the bottom of the controller and running the `Build and Upload` command from the PROS keybind using the `OPTION-COMMAND-M` on MacOS or `CONTROL-ALT-M` on Windows.

<!-- STRUCTURE -->

## Troubleshooting

> Step-by-step guide to identify and resolve common issues encountered during development and deployment.

1. **Missing Files**: Verify that the repository was cloned using GitHub Desktop. If files are missing, re-clone the repository to ensure all dependencies are included.
2. **Unsupported Versions**: Check that the latest versions of PROS, LemLib, and C++ are installed. Update any outdated tools to maintain compatibility with the codebase.
3. **Merge Conflicts**: Before starting work, confirm that no other team member is editing the same file. If conflicts occur, use GitHub Desktop to compare changes and resolve them by selecting the appropriate code.
4. **Build Errors**: If the build and upload process fails when connected to the controller, try the following steps:
  - Ensure the Micro-USB cable is securely connected to both the controller and your computer.
  - Restart the controller and VEX Robot Brain, then attempt the upload again.
  - Verify that the correct COM port is selected in the PROS settings.
  - If the issue persists, disconnect and reconnect the cable, then retry the upload process.
  - Repeat the upload process a few times, as intermittent connectivity issues may resolve after multiple attempts.

<!-- CONVENTIONS -->

## Conventions

> Ensure consistent and clear communication within the team.

- [Branches](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-naming-conventions-for-git-branches/): Using branch prefixes to highlight main objective followed by a brief description of the task or feature. If referencing a specific issue number, that would be appended between the prefix and description. Examples included below:

```
feature/add-PID-controller
fix/tuning-parameters
refactor/autonomous-code
experiment/odometry

# Example with issue reference
fix/2/adjust-for-drag
```

- [Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/): Creating an explicit commit history helps other team members understand the changes made and the purpose behind them. Use the following format for commits: <type>(<scope>): <description>. Examples included below with the use and omission of the optional scope variable:

```
feat(auton): add initial body of PID controller
chore: update LemLib dependency
docs(README): add reference to new LemLib version
```
